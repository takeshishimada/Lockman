/// Unit tests for LockmanDynamicConditionReducer
///
/// Tests the reducer wrapper that provides unified condition evaluation for both reducer-level and action-level exclusive processing.
///
/// ## Test Cases Identified from Source Analysis:
///
/// ### LockmanDynamicConditionReducer Structure and Initialization
/// - [ ] LockmanDynamicConditionReducer<State, Action>: Reducer protocol conformance
/// - [ ] init(base:condition:boundaryId:lockFailure:) with Reduce<State, Action> parameter
/// - [ ] init(_:condition:boundaryId:lockFailure:) with reducer function parameter
/// - [ ] Internal property storage (_base, _condition, _boundaryId, _lockFailure)
/// - [ ] @usableFromInline attribute usage for performance optimization
/// - [ ] Generic type parameter constraints (State: Sendable, Action: Sendable)
/// - [ ] Computed property 'base' for internal access
///
/// ### Reducer-Level Condition Evaluation
/// - [ ] reduce(into:action:) method implementation with condition evaluation
/// - [ ] Condition function invocation with current state and action
/// - [ ] LockmanResult processing from condition evaluation
/// - [ ] .cancel result handling with lockFailure handler invocation
/// - [ ] .success result processing with base reducer execution
/// - [ ] .successWithPrecedingCancellation result processing
/// - [ ] Base reducer effect execution after successful condition
///
/// ### Condition Result Processing and Effect Management
/// - [ ] .cancel condition result prevents base reducer execution
/// - [ ] .success/.successWithPrecedingCancellation enables base reducer execution
/// - [ ] Cancellable effect application with boundary ID
/// - [ ] Effect.cancellable(id: boundaryId) integration
/// - [ ] .none effect return when condition fails without handler
/// - [ ] .run effect creation for lockFailure handler execution
/// - [ ] Async handler execution with error and send parameters
///

/// - [ ] Operation closure parameter with Send<Action> parameter
/// - [ ] Catch handler parameter for operation error handling
/// - [ ] LockFailure handler parameter for condition failures

/// - [ ] Optional lockCondition parameter for action-level control
///
/// ### Action-Level Condition Evaluation
/// - [ ] Optional lockCondition parameter handling
/// - [ ] LockCondition function invocation with state and action
/// - [ ] Condition result processing for action-level operations
/// - [ ] .cancel result with lockFailure handler invocation
/// - [ ] .success/.successWithPrecedingCancellation with operation execution
/// - [ ] No condition behavior (always execute operation)
/// - [ ] Condition vs no-condition execution paths
///
/// ### Effect Creation and Cancellation
/// - [ ] Effect<Action>.run(priority:operation:catch:) integration

///
/// ### Two-Level Exclusive Processing Architecture
/// - [ ] Reducer-level condition evaluation independence
/// - [ ] Action-level condition evaluation independence
/// - [ ] Simplified exclusive processing pattern

/// - [ ] Boundary-based effect cancellation coordination
/// - [ ] Independent operation of both levels
///
/// ### Error Handling and Lock Failure Integration
/// - [ ] LockFailure handler parameter types and constraints
/// - [ ] Error parameter passing to lockFailure handlers
