/// Unit tests for LockmanReducer
///
/// Tests the reducer wrapper that applies Lockman locking with true lock-first behavior.
///
/// ## Test Cases Identified from Source Analysis:
///
/// ### Lock-First Behavior Core Logic
/// - [ ] Lock feasibility check occurs BEFORE base reducer execution
/// - [ ] Base reducer executes ONLY when lock acquisition succeeds
/// - [ ] State mutations prevented when lock cannot be acquired
/// - [ ] True lock-first behavior validation with state inspection
/// - [ ] No state changes occur on lock failure scenarios
///
/// ### Action Processing & Classification
/// - [ ] LockmanAction extraction using provided extractor function
/// - [ ] Non-LockmanAction passthrough to base reducer
/// - [ ] Mixed action types handling (some lockable, some not)
/// - [ ] Action classification accuracy validation
/// - [ ] Custom action extractor function behavior
///
/// ### LockmanInfo Lifecycle Management
/// - [ ] Single lockmanInfo creation per action to ensure consistent uniqueId
/// - [ ] LockmanInfo consistency between lock acquisition and release
/// - [ ] UniqueId preservation throughout lock lifecycle
/// - [ ] CreateLockmanInfo method integration
/// - [ ] Multiple sequential actions uniqueId uniqueness
///
/// ### Lock Result Processing
/// - [ ] .success lock result enables base reducer execution
/// - [ ] .successWithPrecedingCancellation enables base reducer execution
/// - [ ] .cancel lock result prevents base reducer execution
/// - [ ] Lock result propagation to effect building
/// - [ ] Correct lock result interpretation and handling
///
/// ### Effect Management & Integration
/// - [ ] Base reducer effect integration with lock effects
/// - [ ] Effect building with existing lock result
/// - [ ] Effect composition between base and lock effects
/// - [ ] Effect cancellation on lock failure
/// - [ ] .none effect return on operation cancellation
///
/// ### Strategy Resolution & Error Handling
/// - [ ] Effect-based strategy resolution functionality
/// - [ ] Strategy resolution failure handling
/// - [ ] Strategy-related errors propagation to lock failure handler
/// - [ ] Existential type limitation workarounds
/// - [ ] Type-safe strategy resolution before reducer execution
///
/// ### Lock Failure Handling
/// - [ ] Lock failure handler invocation on lock acquisition failure
/// - [ ] Lock failure handler receives correct error and send closure
/// - [ ] No lock failure handler results in .none effect
/// - [ ] Lock failure handler with async operations
/// - [ ] Custom error handling patterns in lock failure scenarios
///
/// ### Boundary ID Management
/// - [ ] Boundary ID parameter propagation to lock operations
/// - [ ] Type-erased boundary ID handling
/// - [ ] Boundary-specific locking behavior
/// - [ ] Boundary ID consistency across lock operations
/// - [ ] Multiple boundary IDs within single reducer
///
/// ### Unlock Option Configuration
/// - [ ] Unlock option parameter propagation to effects
/// - [ ] Different unlock option behaviors validation
/// - [ ] Unlock option impact on effect lifecycle
/// - [ ] Custom unlock option configurations
/// - [ ] Default unlock option behavior
///
/// ### Reducer Composition & Nesting
/// - [ ] LockmanReducer with nested base reducers
/// - [ ] Multiple LockmanReducer layers
/// - [ ] Reducer composition with other reducer combinators
/// - [ ] Base reducer complexity handling
/// - [ ] Reducer hierarchy integration patterns
///
/// ### State Mutation Prevention
/// - [ ] State immutability when locks cannot be acquired
/// - [ ] State consistency across failed lock attempts
/// - [ ] State rollback prevention mechanisms
/// - [ ] Memory safety with prevented state mutations
/// - [ ] Concurrent state access protection
///
/// ### Effect Lifecycle & Cleanup
/// - [ ] Guaranteed unlock when effects complete
/// - [ ] Effect cancellation cleanup behavior
/// - [ ] Lock release on effect completion
/// - [ ] Effect failure cleanup mechanisms
/// - [ ] Resource cleanup on reducer disposal
///
/// ### Thread Safety & Concurrency
/// - [ ] Concurrent action processing safety
/// - [ ] Thread-safe lock acquisition checking
/// - [ ] Race condition handling in lock-first logic
/// - [ ] Memory safety under concurrent access
/// - [ ] Sendable compliance validation
///
/// ### Integration with ComposableArchitecture
/// - [ ] Store integration and state management
/// - [ ] ViewStore compatibility
/// - [ ] Effect middleware compatibility
/// - [ ] Reducer protocol conformance
/// - [ ] TCA lifecycle integration
///
/// ### Real-world Usage Patterns
/// - [ ] Common reducer patterns with locking
/// - [ ] Error recovery scenarios
/// - [ ] Performance characteristics under load
/// - [ ] Memory usage patterns
/// - [ ] Integration with existing TCA applications
///
/// ### Documentation Examples Validation
/// - [ ] Counter increment/decrement example implementation
/// - [ ] Lock behavior with side effects
/// - [ ] CancelID usage patterns
/// - [ ] Boundary-specific locking examples
/// - [ ] Real reducer integration scenarios
