/// Unit tests for AnyLockmanStrategy
///
/// Tests the type-erased wrapper for any LockmanStrategy<I>, enabling heterogeneous strategy
/// storage and manipulation while preserving type safety for lock information.
///
/// ## Test Cases Identified from Source Analysis:
///
/// ### Type Erasure Structure and Purpose
/// - [ ] AnyLockmanStrategy<I: LockmanInfo> generic wrapper creation
/// - [ ] LockmanStrategy protocol conformance with type erasure
/// - [ ] Sendable conformance for concurrent usage
/// - [ ] Heterogeneous strategy collection storage capability
/// - [ ] Runtime strategy selection and dynamic behavior
///
/// ### Type-Erased Function Storage
/// - [ ] _canLock: @Sendable (any LockmanBoundaryId, I) -> LockmanResult closure storage
/// - [ ] _lock: @Sendable (any LockmanBoundaryId, I) -> Void closure storage
/// - [ ] _unlock: @Sendable (any LockmanBoundaryId, I) -> Void closure storage
/// - [ ] _cleanUp: @Sendable () -> Void closure storage
/// - [ ] _cleanUpById: @Sendable (any LockmanBoundaryId) -> Void closure storage
/// - [ ] _getCurrentLocks: @Sendable () -> [AnyLockmanBoundaryId: [any LockmanInfo]] closure storage
/// - [ ] _strategyId: LockmanStrategyId storage
///
/// ### Initialization and Type Erasure Process
/// - [ ] init<S: LockmanStrategy>(_ strategy: S) where S.I == I constraint verification
/// - [ ] Concrete strategy method capture as closures
/// - [ ] Type constraint S.I == I compile-time safety enforcement
/// - [ ] Closure capture list [strategy] for lifetime management
/// - [ ] Strategy ID preservation during type erasure
///
/// ### Memory Management and Lifetime
/// - [ ] Class-based strategy retention through closures
/// - [ ] Struct-based strategy copying into closures
/// - [ ] Memory leak prevention in closure captures
/// - [ ] Proper lifetime management without strong reference cycles
/// - [ ] Strategy instance availability throughout wrapper lifetime
///
/// ### LockmanStrategy Protocol Implementation
/// - [ ] strategyId property returns preserved concrete strategy ID
/// - [ ] makeStrategyId() returns generic type-erased strategy ID
/// - [ ] Generic identifier format with lock info type inclusion
/// - [ ] Strategy identification consistency across type erasure
///
/// ### canLock Method Delegation
/// - [ ] canLock<B: LockmanBoundaryId>(boundaryId:info:) signature preservation
/// - [ ] Transparent delegation to concrete strategy implementation
/// - [ ] LockmanResult return type preservation
/// - [ ] Error propagation without modification
/// - [ ] Identical behavior to direct concrete strategy calls
///
/// ### lock Method Delegation
/// - [ ] lock<B: LockmanBoundaryId>(boundaryId:info:) method delegation
/// - [ ] Precondition enforcement (canLock success requirement)
/// - [ ] State management delegation to concrete strategy
/// - [ ] Thread safety preservation through delegation
/// - [ ] No additional state management in wrapper
///
/// ### unlock Method Delegation
/// - [ ] unlock<B: LockmanBoundaryId>(boundaryId:info:) method delegation
/// - [ ] Parameter matching requirement preservation
/// - [ ] Exact instance identification delegation (uniqueId-based)
/// - [ ] Error recovery behavior delegation
/// - [ ] Defensive programming pattern preservation
///
/// ### cleanUp Methods Delegation
/// - [ ] cleanUp() global cleanup delegation
/// - [ ] cleanUp<B: LockmanBoundaryId>(boundaryId:) boundary-specific cleanup delegation
/// - [ ] All boundaries cleanup scope preservation
/// - [ ] Selective cleanup isolation behavior preservation
/// - [ ] Thread safety and atomicity delegation
///
/// ### getCurrentLocks Debug Information
/// - [ ] getCurrentLocks() method delegation
/// - [ ] Debug information snapshot consistency
/// - [ ] Type erasure handling in returned dictionary
/// - [ ] Boundary-to-locks mapping preservation
/// - [ ] Thread-safe snapshot provision
///
/// ### Type Safety Guarantees
/// - [ ] Lock information type I preservation across type erasure
/// - [ ] Compile-time type safety with where S.I == I constraint
/// - [ ] Runtime type consistency maintenance
/// - [ ] Generic parameter propagation correctness
/// - [ ] Type mismatch prevention at compilation
///
/// ### Performance Characteristics
/// - [ ] Function pointer indirection overhead measurement
/// - [ ] Type erasure initialization cost analysis
/// - [ ] Method call performance compared to direct strategy calls
/// - [ ] Memory overhead of closure storage
/// - [ ] Negligible runtime cost justification
///
/// ### Integration with Strategy Container
/// - [ ] Heterogeneous strategy storage in container
/// - [ ] Type-erased strategy registration and resolution
/// - [ ] Strategy ID consistency in container operations
/// - [ ] Multiple strategy type coexistence
/// - [ ] Container-wrapper interaction patterns
///
/// ### Delegation Pattern Verification
/// - [ ] Transparent proxy behavior verification
/// - [ ] Method call forwarding without modification
/// - [ ] Error propagation transparency
/// - [ ] State management delegation completeness
/// - [ ] Behavioral identity preservation
///
/// ### Thread Safety and Concurrent Access
/// - [ ] @Sendable closure marking for concurrent safety
/// - [ ] Concurrent method call safety through delegation
/// - [ ] Thread-safe access to type-erased functions
/// - [ ] Concurrent wrapper instance usage
/// - [ ] Race condition prevention through underlying strategy
///
/// ### API Boundaries and Interface Hiding
/// - [ ] Concrete strategy type hiding from public interfaces
/// - [ ] API boundary compatibility
/// - [ ] Interface abstraction effectiveness
/// - [ ] Client code isolation from concrete types
/// - [ ] Public API surface simplification
///
/// ### Dependency Injection and Registration
/// - [ ] Flexible strategy registration through type erasure
/// - [ ] Runtime strategy selection capability
/// - [ ] Dependency injection container integration
/// - [ ] Strategy resolution by ID with type erasure
/// - [ ] Configuration-based strategy selection
///
/// ### Universal Compatibility Testing
/// - [ ] Class-based strategy compatibility
/// - [ ] Struct-based strategy compatibility
/// - [ ] Built-in strategy integration (SingleExecution, PriorityBased)
/// - [ ] Custom strategy implementation support
/// - [ ] Mixed strategy type usage scenarios
///
/// ### Error Handling and Edge Cases
/// - [ ] Concrete strategy error propagation accuracy
/// - [ ] Type erasure error scenarios
/// - [ ] Invalid parameter handling delegation
/// - [ ] Resource exhaustion impact on type erasure
/// - [ ] Wrapper-specific error cases (if any)
///
/// ### Documentation and Usage Patterns
/// - [ ] Type erasure benefit realization in practice
/// - [ ] Heterogeneous collection usage patterns
