/// Unit tests for AnyLockmanBoundaryId
///
/// Tests the type-erased wrapper for heterogeneous boundary identifiers.
///
/// ## Test Cases Identified from Source Analysis:
///
/// ### Type Erasure Implementation
/// - [ ] AnyHashable-based storage validation
/// - [ ] Type erasure wrapper construction
/// - [ ] init(_ value: any LockmanBoundaryId) functionality
/// - [ ] Private base property encapsulation
/// - [ ] Value semantics preservation
///
/// ### Hashable Implementation
/// - [ ] Equality comparison through AnyHashable
/// - [ ] Hash value generation through base.hash(into:)
/// - [ ] Type-aware equality (different types â‰  equal)
/// - [ ] Hash collision prevention with type information
/// - [ ] Consistent hashing behavior
///
/// ### @unchecked Sendable Validation
/// - [ ] Thread-safe usage justification
/// - [ ] AnyHashable thread safety inheritance
/// - [ ] No additional mutable state verification
/// - [ ] Safe concurrent access validation
/// - [ ] Concurrent collection usage safety
///
/// ### Heterogeneous Storage Testing
/// - [ ] Dictionary<AnyLockmanBoundaryId, Value> usage
/// - [ ] Set<AnyLockmanBoundaryId> usage
/// - [ ] Mixed boundary ID types in same collection
/// - [ ] Type safety with heterogeneous storage
/// - [ ] Collection performance with mixed types
///
/// ### Built-in Type Wrapping
/// - [ ] String boundary ID wrapping
/// - [ ] Int boundary ID wrapping
/// - [ ] UUID boundary ID wrapping
/// - [ ] Enum boundary ID wrapping
/// - [ ] Struct boundary ID wrapping
///
/// ### Custom Type Integration
/// - [ ] UserBoundary enum example validation
/// - [ ] SessionBoundary struct example validation
/// - [ ] Complex custom type wrapping
/// - [ ] Raw value preservation
/// - [ ] Custom equality behavior preservation
///
/// ### Equality and Hashing Behavior
/// - [ ] Same type, same value equality
/// - [ ] Same type, different value inequality
/// - [ ] Different type, same value inequality
/// - [ ] Hash consistency for equal instances
/// - [ ] Hash uniqueness for different instances
/// - [ ] Transitivity and reflexivity validation
///
/// ### Performance & Memory
/// - [ ] Wrapping overhead measurement
/// - [ ] Memory footprint with AnyHashable
/// - [ ] Hash computation performance
/// - [ ] Equality comparison performance
/// - [ ] Large-scale type erasure usage
///
/// ### Thread Safety & Concurrency
/// - [ ] Concurrent wrapper creation
/// - [ ] Concurrent equality comparisons
/// - [ ] Concurrent hash operations
/// - [ ] Thread-safe collection operations
/// - [ ] Race condition prevention
///
/// ### Integration with Strategy System
/// - [ ] Strategy boundary management with type erasure
/// - [ ] Lock acquisition with erased boundary IDs
/// - [ ] Cleanup operations with mixed boundary types
/// - [ ] Container storage with heterogeneous boundaries
/// - [ ] Debug output with type-erased boundaries
///
/// ### Real-world Usage Patterns
/// - [ ] Multi-module boundary coordination
/// - [ ] Cross-feature boundary management
/// - [ ] Dynamic boundary type handling
/// - [ ] Plugin-based boundary systems
/// - [ ] Framework-level boundary abstraction
///
/// ### Edge Cases & Error Conditions
/// - [ ] Wrapping nil-equivalent values (if possible)
/// - [ ] Very large boundary ID values
/// - [ ] Complex nested boundary structures
/// - [ ] Memory pressure with many wrapped instances
/// - [ ] Type information preservation edge cases
///
/// ### Documentation Examples Validation
/// - [ ] UserBoundary enum example
/// - [ ] SessionBoundary struct example
/// - [ ] Mixed collection usage example
/// - [ ] Code example correctness verification
/// - [ ] Usage pattern validation from documentation
///
