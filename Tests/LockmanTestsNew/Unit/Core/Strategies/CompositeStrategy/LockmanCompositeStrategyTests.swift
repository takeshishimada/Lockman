/// Unit tests for LockmanCompositeStrategy
///
/// Tests the composite strategies (2-5 strategies) that coordinate locking between multiple different strategies,
/// ensuring all component strategies can acquire their locks before proceeding.
///
/// ## Test Cases Identified from Source Analysis:
///
/// ### LockmanCompositeStrategy2 - Initialization and Configuration
/// - [ ] init(strategy1:strategy2:) with different strategy types
/// - [ ] strategyId generation from component strategies
/// - [ ] makeStrategyId(strategy1:strategy2:) creates unique composite ID
/// - [ ] makeStrategyId() parameterless version returns generic ID
/// - [ ] LockmanCompositeInfo2<I1, I2> typealias usage
/// - [ ] @unchecked Sendable conformance verification
///
/// ### LockmanCompositeStrategy3 - Initialization and Configuration
/// - [ ] init(strategy1:strategy2:strategy3:) with three strategies
/// - [ ] strategyId generation with three component strategy IDs
/// - [ ] makeStrategyId with three parameters
/// - [ ] LockmanCompositeInfo3<I1, I2, I3> typealias usage
///
/// ### LockmanCompositeStrategy4 - Initialization and Configuration
/// - [ ] init with four component strategies
/// - [ ] strategyId generation with four component strategy IDs
/// - [ ] LockmanCompositeInfo4<I1, I2, I3, I4> typealias usage
///
/// ### LockmanCompositeStrategy5 - Initialization and Configuration
/// - [ ] init with five component strategies
/// - [ ] strategyId generation with five component strategy IDs
/// - [ ] LockmanCompositeInfo5<I1, I2, I3, I4, I5> typealias usage
///
/// ### canLock Method - All Strategies Success
/// - [ ] All component strategies return .success -> composite returns .success
/// - [ ] All strategies are checked before proceeding
/// - [ ] coordinateResults handles all .success cases correctly
/// - [ ] LockmanLogger.logCanLock called with correct parameters
/// - [ ] Proper strategy name "Composite" in logs
///
/// ### canLock Method - Early Return on First Failure
/// - [ ] Strategy1 failure -> immediate .cancel return (Strategy2+ not checked)
/// - [ ] Strategy2 failure -> immediate .cancel return (Strategy3+ not checked)
/// - [ ] Strategy3 failure -> immediate .cancel return (Strategy4+ not checked)
/// - [ ] Strategy4 failure -> immediate .cancel return (Strategy5 not checked)
/// - [ ] Strategy5 failure -> immediate .cancel return
/// - [ ] Proper failure reason logging ("Strategy1 failed", etc.)
///
/// ### canLock Method - Mixed Success and Cancellation Results
/// - [ ] Some strategies return .success, others return .successWithPrecedingCancellation
/// - [ ] coordinateResults returns .successWithPrecedingCancellation with first error
/// - [ ] Multiple cancellation errors -> first one is preserved
/// - [ ] LockmanPrecedingCancellationError propagation correctness
///
/// ### coordinateResults Private Method Logic
/// - [ ] Any .cancel result causes immediate composite failure
/// - [ ] .successWithPrecedingCancellation preserves first error found
/// - [ ] All .success results -> composite .success
/// - [ ] @unknown default case handling with logging
/// - [ ] Variadic parameter handling for different strategy counts
///
/// ### lock Method - Sequential Lock Acquisition
/// - [ ] LockmanCompositeStrategy2: strategy1.lock() then strategy2.lock()
/// - [ ] LockmanCompositeStrategy3: strategy1 -> strategy2 -> strategy3
/// - [ ] LockmanCompositeStrategy4: strategy1 -> strategy2 -> strategy3 -> strategy4
/// - [ ] LockmanCompositeStrategy5: strategy1 -> strategy2 -> strategy3 -> strategy4 -> strategy5
/// - [ ] Correct info forwarding to each component strategy
/// - [ ] Order preservation during lock acquisition
///
/// ### unlock Method - Reverse Order Release (LIFO)
/// - [ ] LockmanCompositeStrategy2: strategy2.unlock() then strategy1.unlock()
/// - [ ] LockmanCompositeStrategy3: strategy3 -> strategy2 -> strategy1
/// - [ ] LockmanCompositeStrategy4: strategy4 -> strategy3 -> strategy2 -> strategy1
/// - [ ] LockmanCompositeStrategy5: strategy5 -> strategy4 -> strategy3 -> strategy2 -> strategy1
/// - [ ] LIFO unlock order prevents deadlock scenarios
/// - [ ] Correct info forwarding during unlock
///
/// ### cleanUp Methods - Global and Boundary-Specific
/// - [ ] cleanUp() calls cleanUp() on all component strategies
/// - [ ] cleanUp(boundaryId:) calls cleanUp(boundaryId:) on all strategies
/// - [ ] All strategies cleaned up regardless of individual cleanup results
/// - [ ] Order of cleanup operations
/// - [ ] Cleanup operation safety and error handling
///
/// ### getCurrentLocks Debug Information
/// - [ ] Merges lock information from all component strategies
/// - [ ] Correct boundary ID to lock info array mapping
/// - [ ] Default array creation for new boundary IDs
/// - [ ] Complete lock information aggregation
/// - [ ] Type-erased LockmanInfo instances in returned values
///
/// ### Strategy ID Generation and Uniqueness
/// - [ ] Composite strategy ID includes component strategy IDs
/// - [ ] Configuration string format: "strategy1+strategy2+..."
/// - [ ] Unique IDs for different component strategy combinations
/// - [ ] Name format: "CompositeStrategy2", "CompositeStrategy3", etc.
/// - [ ] ID consistency across multiple instantiations with same strategies
///
/// ### Generic Type System and Constraints
/// - [ ] Multiple generic type parameters for different info types
/// - [ ] Where clause constraints: S1.I == I1, S2.I == I2, etc.
/// - [ ] Type safety across different strategy combinations
/// - [ ] LockmanStrategy protocol conformance for each component
/// - [ ] LockmanInfo protocol conformance for each info type
///
/// ### Integration with Component Strategies
/// - [ ] Integration with LockmanSingleExecutionStrategy + LockmanPriorityBasedStrategy
/// - [ ] Integration with built-in strategies + custom strategies
/// - [ ] Mixed strategy types with different behavior patterns
/// - [ ] Strategy interaction and conflict resolution
/// - [ ] Component strategy state isolation
///
/// ### Error Handling and Edge Cases
/// - [ ] Component strategy throws during canLock
/// - [ ] Component strategy throws during lock/unlock
/// - [ ] Null or invalid component strategies
/// - [ ] Empty lock info scenarios
/// - [ ] Resource exhaustion in component strategies
///
/// ### Thread Safety and Concurrency
/// - [ ] @unchecked Sendable conformance correctness
/// - [ ] Thread-safe access to component strategies
/// - [ ] Concurrent canLock calls on same composite strategy
/// - [ ] Concurrent lock/unlock operations
/// - [ ] Race condition prevention in coordination logic
///
/// ### Performance Characteristics
/// - [ ] Early return optimization in canLock method
/// - [ ] Minimal overhead compared to individual strategy calls
/// - [ ] Efficient result coordination logic
/// - [ ] Memory efficiency with multiple component strategies
/// - [ ] Performance impact of sequential vs parallel strategy checking
///
/// ### Logging Integration
/// - [ ] LockmanLogger.logCanLock with composite strategy name
/// - [ ] Proper boundaryId string representation in logs
/// - [ ] Failure reason messages for each strategy position
/// - [ ] Log message consistency across different composite strategy sizes
/// - [ ] Unknown case logging in coordinateResults
///
/// ### Protocol Conformance Verification
/// - [ ] LockmanStrategy protocol implementation completeness
/// - [ ] Required method implementations for all composite strategies
/// - [ ] Generic type alias correctness (I = LockmanCompositeInfo...)
/// - [ ] Boundary type handling consistency
/// - [ ] Result type handling across all methods
///
/// ### Complex Coordination Scenarios
/// - [ ] Nested composite strategies (composite of composites)
/// - [ ] Same strategy type used multiple times in different positions
/// - [ ] Strategies with overlapping boundary requirements
/// - [ ] Mixed execution patterns (exclusive, priority-based, etc.)
/// - [ ] Error propagation through complex strategy hierarchies
///
/// ### Memory Management and Resource Cleanup
/// - [ ] Proper cleanup of component strategy resources
/// - [ ] Memory leak prevention with multiple strategies
/// - [ ] Resource cleanup order and dependencies
/// - [ ] Long-running composite strategy stability
/// - [ ] Component strategy lifecycle management
///
/// ### Info Type Coordination
/// - [ ] LockmanCompositeInfo2/3/4/5 integration with component strategies
/// - [ ] Info extraction for each strategy (lockmanInfoForStrategy1, etc.)
/// - [ ] Type safety during info forwarding
/// - [ ] Complex info type hierarchies
/// - [ ] Info consistency across lock/unlock operations
