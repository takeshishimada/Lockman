/// Unit tests for LockmanConcurrencyLimitedStrategy
///
/// Tests the strategy that limits the number of concurrent executions per concurrency group,
/// enabling fine-grained control over resource usage and parallel execution limits.
///
/// ## Test Cases Identified from Source Analysis:
///
/// ### Strategy Initialization and Configuration
/// - [ ] Shared singleton instance access and consistency
/// - [ ] Private initializer enforcement (singleton pattern)
/// - [ ] makeStrategyId() returns "concurrencyLimited" identifier
/// - [ ] Strategy ID consistency across multiple calls
/// - [ ] @unchecked Sendable conformance verification
/// - [ ] Thread-safe state container initialization with concurrencyId keys
///
/// ### LockmanStrategy Protocol Implementation
/// - [ ] Typealias I = LockmanConcurrencyLimitedInfo correctness
/// - [ ] All required protocol methods implementation verification
/// - [ ] Generic boundary type handling in all methods
/// - [ ] Protocol conformance completeness
///
/// ### Concurrency Limit Enforcement - canLock Method
/// - [ ] Success when current count is below limit
/// - [ ] Cancellation when limit is exactly reached
/// - [ ] Cancellation when limit is exceeded
/// - [ ] .unlimited limit behavior (always allows)
/// - [ ] .limited(n) limit behavior with various values
/// - [ ] Zero limit handling (.limited(0))
/// - [ ] Large limit values handling
///
/// ### Concurrency Group Management
/// - [ ] Multiple concurrency groups within same boundary
/// - [ ] Independent limit tracking per concurrency group
/// - [ ] ConcurrencyId-based key extraction and indexing
/// - [ ] String-based concurrency ID handling
/// - [ ] Empty concurrency ID edge cases
///
/// ### Lock State Management - lock/unlock Methods
/// - [ ] Successful lock addition after canLock success
/// - [ ] Exact info instance preservation with uniqueId
/// - [ ] Thread-safe lock addition across concurrent calls
/// - [ ] State consistency after multiple lock operations
/// - [ ] Unlock removes specific lock instance by uniqueId
/// - [ ] Other locks in same concurrency group remain unaffected
///
/// ### Concurrent Execution Scenarios
/// - [ ] Multiple locks within same concurrency group up to limit
/// - [ ] Mixing different concurrency groups in same boundary
/// - [ ] Rapid lock/unlock cycles within same group
/// - [ ] Lock acquisition order independence
/// - [ ] First-come-first-served behavior within limits
///
/// ### Error Generation and Handling
/// - [ ] LockmanConcurrencyLimitedError.concurrencyLimitReached creation
/// - [ ] Error contains correct lockmanInfo, boundaryId, currentCount
/// - [ ] Error message includes limit details and current count
/// - [ ] Proper error context for debugging
/// - [ ] Error consistency across different limit scenarios
///
/// ### LockmanConcurrencyLimit Integration
/// - [ ] .unlimited limit integration and behavior
/// - [ ] .limited(Int) limit integration and enforcement
/// - [ ] isExceeded(currentCount:) method usage
/// - [ ] Edge cases with limit boundary conditions
/// - [ ] Limit type switching scenarios
///
/// ### Cleanup Operations
/// - [ ] cleanUp() removes all locks across all boundaries and groups
/// - [ ] cleanUp(boundaryId:) removes only specified boundary locks
/// - [ ] Other boundaries remain unaffected by boundary-specific cleanup
/// - [ ] State emptiness after global cleanup
/// - [ ] Concurrency group isolation during cleanup
///
/// ### Performance Characteristics (Unit Test Level)
/// - [ ] activeLockCount returns correct count value
/// - [ ] Concurrency ID-based key extraction functionality
/// - [ ] Lock storage behavior with multiple concurrent locks
/// - [ ] State container behavior with multiple concurrency groups
/// - [ ] Lock acquisition/release order verification
///
/// ### Thread Safety Verification
/// - [ ] Concurrent canLock calls on same concurrency group
/// - [ ] Concurrent lock/unlock operations across threads
/// - [ ] Race condition prevention in limit checking
/// - [ ] State consistency under high concurrent load
/// - [ ] LockmanState thread-safety delegation verification
///
/// ### getCurrentLocks Debug Information
/// - [ ] Returns empty dictionary when no locks exist
/// - [ ] Correct boundary-to-locks mapping
/// - [ ] Type-erased LockmanInfo instances in results
/// - [ ] Consistent snapshot of current state
/// - [ ] Thread-safe access to debug information
/// - [ ] Concurrency group information preservation
///
/// ### Logging Integration
/// - [ ] LockmanLogger.logCanLock called with correct parameters
/// - [ ] Strategy name "ConcurrencyLimited" in logs
/// - [ ] Failure reason includes concurrency ID and limit details
/// - [ ] Log message format: "current/limit" for exceeded scenarios
/// - [ ] Boundary ID string representation in logs
///
/// ### Complex Concurrency Scenarios
/// - [ ] Multiple boundaries with same concurrency group names
/// - [ ] Mixed limit types across different concurrency groups
/// - [ ] Dynamic limit changes (if applicable)
/// - [ ] High-frequency lock churn within limits
/// - [ ] Stress testing with rapid concurrent operations
///
/// ### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
/// - [ ] Empty concurrency ID handling
/// - [ ] Very long concurrency ID names
/// - [ ] Special characters in concurrency IDs
/// - [ ] Negative limit values (should not occur but test robustness)
/// - [ ] Integer overflow scenarios with very large counts
///
/// ### Integration with Boundary System
/// - [ ] Multiple boundaries with independent concurrency tracking
/// - [ ] Boundary isolation verification
/// - [ ] AnyLockmanBoundaryId type erasure correctness
/// - [ ] Cross-boundary concurrency group independence
/// - [ ] Boundary cleanup impact on other boundaries
///
/// ### Memory Management and Resource Cleanup
/// - [ ] Proper cleanup of concurrency group tracking
/// - [ ] Memory leak prevention during long-running operations
/// - [ ] Resource cleanup completeness after operations
/// - [ ] State container memory management
/// - [ ] Lock info instance lifecycle management
///
/// ### Functional Usage Verification
/// - [ ] Limit enforcement with various limit values
/// - [ ] Concurrency group separation behavior
/// - [ ] Action execution control within limits
/// - [ ] Lock release behavior and slot availability
/// - [ ] Strategy behavior with different configuration types
