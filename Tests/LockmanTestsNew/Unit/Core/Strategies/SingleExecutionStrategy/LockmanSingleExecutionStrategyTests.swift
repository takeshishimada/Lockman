/// Unit tests for LockmanSingleExecutionStrategy
///
/// Tests the locking strategy that provides flexible execution control within a boundary
/// with three execution modes: none, boundary, and action.
///
/// ## Test Cases Identified from Source Analysis:
///
/// ### Strategy Initialization and Configuration
/// - [ ] Shared singleton instance access and consistency
/// - [ ] Custom instance creation and strategyId uniqueness
/// - [ ] makeStrategyId() returns correct "singleExecution" identifier
/// - [ ] Thread-safe state container initialization
/// - [ ] @unchecked Sendable conformance verification
///
/// ### ExecutionMode Enum Testing
/// - [ ] ExecutionMode.none case creation and equality
/// - [ ] ExecutionMode.boundary case creation and equality
/// - [ ] ExecutionMode.action case creation and equality
/// - [ ] Sendable conformance for ExecutionMode
/// - [ ] Equatable conformance for ExecutionMode
///
/// ### canLock Method - Mode.none
/// - [ ] Always returns .success regardless of existing locks
/// - [ ] No state modification during canLock with mode.none
/// - [ ] Consistent behavior across multiple calls with mode.none
/// - [ ] Bypasses all lock checking logic for mode.none
///
/// ### canLock Method - Mode.boundary
/// - [ ] Returns .success when no locks exist in boundary
/// - [ ] Returns .cancel when any lock exists in boundary
/// - [ ] Proper LockmanSingleExecutionError.boundaryAlreadyLocked creation
/// - [ ] Error contains correct boundaryId and existing lockInfo
/// - [ ] Different action IDs are blocked within same boundary
///
/// ### canLock Method - Mode.action
/// - [ ] Returns .success when no matching actionId exists
/// - [ ] Returns .cancel when same actionId already locked
/// - [ ] Allows different actionIds within same boundary
/// - [ ] Proper LockmanSingleExecutionError.actionAlreadyRunning creation
/// - [ ] Error contains correct boundaryId and existing lockInfo
///
/// ### lock Method Implementation
/// - [ ] Successfully adds lock to state after canLock success
/// - [ ] Preserves exact info instance with uniqueId
/// - [ ] Thread-safe lock addition across concurrent calls
/// - [ ] State consistency after multiple lock operations
/// - [ ] No state modification if canLock would fail
///
/// ### unlock Method Implementation
/// - [ ] Successfully removes specific lock instance by uniqueId
/// - [ ] Only removes exact info instance that was locked
/// - [ ] Other locks with same actionId remain unaffected
/// - [ ] Thread-safe unlock operations
/// - [ ] No effect when unlocking non-existent lock
/// - [ ] State consistency after unlock operations
///
/// ### Instance-Specific Lock Management
/// - [ ] Multiple instances with same actionId get different uniqueIds
/// - [ ] Unlock only removes the specific instance that was locked
/// - [ ] Different boundaries can have same actionId simultaneously
/// - [ ] 1:1 correspondence between lock() and unlock() calls
///
/// ### Global Cleanup Operations
/// - [ ] cleanUp() removes all locks across all boundaries
/// - [ ] cleanUp(boundaryId:) removes only specified boundary locks
/// - [ ] Other boundaries remain unaffected by boundary-specific cleanup
/// - [ ] State is empty after global cleanup
/// - [ ] Thread-safe cleanup operations
///
/// ### getCurrentLocks Debug Information
/// - [ ] Returns empty dictionary when no locks exist
/// - [ ] Returns correct boundary-to-locks mapping
/// - [ ] Type-erased LockmanInfo instances in returned values
/// - [ ] Consistent snapshot of current state
/// - [ ] Thread-safe access to current locks information
///
/// ### Logging Integration
/// - [ ] LockmanLogger.logCanLock called with correct parameters
/// - [ ] Proper strategy name "SingleExecution" in logs
/// - [ ] Correct failure reason messages for boundary/action conflicts
/// - [ ] Log messages include boundaryId string representation
///
/// ### Error Handling and Edge Cases
/// - [ ] Graceful handling of empty actionId strings
/// - [ ] Behavior with nil or empty boundary identifiers
/// - [ ] State consistency under high concurrent load
/// - [ ] Memory management for long-running locks
/// - [ ] Error object lifecycle and memory safety
///
/// ### Thread Safety Verification
/// - [ ] Concurrent canLock calls on same boundary
/// - [ ] Concurrent lock/unlock operations
/// - [ ] Concurrent cleanup operations
/// - [ ] State consistency under race conditions
/// - [ ] LockmanState thread-safety delegation
///
/// ### Protocol Conformance
/// - [ ] LockmanStrategy protocol implementation completeness
/// - [ ] Correct typealias I = LockmanSingleExecutionInfo
/// - [ ] All required protocol methods implemented
/// - [ ] Generic boundary type handling
///
