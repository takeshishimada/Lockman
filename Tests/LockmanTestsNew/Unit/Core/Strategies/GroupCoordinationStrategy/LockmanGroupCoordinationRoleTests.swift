/// Unit tests for LockmanGroupCoordinationRole
///
/// Tests the enumeration defining action roles in group coordination strategy.
///
/// ## Test Cases Identified from Source Analysis:
///
/// ### Enum Case Construction and Properties
/// - [ ] LockmanGroupCoordinationRole.none case creation
/// - [ ] LockmanGroupCoordinationRole.leader(LeaderEntryPolicy) case creation
/// - [ ] LockmanGroupCoordinationRole.member case creation
/// - [ ] Sendable conformance verification for concurrent usage
/// - [ ] Hashable conformance for Set/Dictionary usage
/// - [ ] Associated value access for leader case
///
/// ### LeaderEntryPolicy Enum Testing
/// - [ ] LeaderEntryPolicy.emptyGroup case behavior
/// - [ ] LeaderEntryPolicy.withoutMembers case behavior
/// - [ ] LeaderEntryPolicy.withoutLeader case behavior
/// - [ ] String raw value representation
/// - [ ] CaseIterable conformance validation
/// - [ ] All cases enumeration completeness
///
/// ### Pattern Matching and Switch Usage
/// - [ ] Pattern matching with .none case
/// - [ ] Pattern matching with .leader case and policy extraction
/// - [ ] Pattern matching with .member case
/// - [ ] Exhaustive switch statement coverage
/// - [ ] if case pattern matching for specific roles
/// - [ ] guard case pattern matching for policy access
///
/// ### Hashable Implementation
/// - [ ] Hash consistency for same role instances
/// - [ ] Hash uniqueness for different roles
/// - [ ] Hash behavior with associated values
/// - [ ] Set<LockmanGroupCoordinationRole> usage
/// - [ ] Dictionary key usage validation
///
/// ### Role Behavior Semantics
/// - [ ] .none role concurrent execution allowance
/// - [ ] .leader role exclusion based on entry policy
/// - [ ] .member role dependency on group participants
/// - [ ] Role-specific group state requirements
/// - [ ] Cross-role interaction patterns
///
/// ### LeaderEntryPolicy Behavior
/// - [ ] .emptyGroup policy group state requirements
/// - [ ] .withoutMembers policy allowing other leaders
/// - [ ] .withoutLeader policy allowing members
/// - [ ] Policy-specific conflict detection
/// - [ ] Policy comparison and ordering
///
/// ### Integration with Group Coordination
/// - [ ] Role enforcement in group coordination strategy
/// - [ ] Group state validation based on roles
/// - [ ] Leader-member relationship validation
/// - [ ] Multi-leader coordination with policies
/// - [ ] Group lifecycle role transitions
///
/// ### Thread Safety & Sendable
/// - [ ] Sendable compliance across concurrent contexts
/// - [ ] Immutable enum case thread safety
/// - [ ] Safe concurrent access to associated values
/// - [ ] No shared mutable state verification
///
/// ### Performance & Memory
/// - [ ] Enum case creation performance
/// - [ ] Pattern matching performance
/// - [ ] Hash computation performance
/// - [ ] Memory footprint validation
/// - [ ] Large-scale role usage
///
/// ### Real-world Role Scenarios
/// - [ ] Navigation leader with emptyGroup policy
/// - [ ] Data loading leader with withoutMembers policy
/// - [ ] Animation member coordination
/// - [ ] Complex multi-role group scenarios
/// - [ ] Role-based access control patterns
///
/// ### Edge Cases & Error Conditions
/// - [ ] Role comparison with different policies
/// - [ ] Role equality with same policies
/// - [ ] Role hashing with complex associated values
/// - [ ] Memory pressure scenarios
///
/// ### String Representation & Debug
/// - [ ] Role string representation for debugging
/// - [ ] Policy string representation (raw values)
/// - [ ] Debug output readability
/// - [ ] Role description formatting
///
/// ### CaseIterable Implementation
/// - [ ] LeaderEntryPolicy.allCases completeness
/// - [ ] Case iteration order consistency
/// - [ ] All cases accessibility
/// - [ ] Dynamic case enumeration
