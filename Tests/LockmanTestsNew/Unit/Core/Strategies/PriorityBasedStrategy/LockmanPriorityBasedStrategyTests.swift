/// Unit tests for LockmanPriorityBasedStrategy
///
/// Tests the locking strategy that enforces priority-based execution semantics
/// with configurable concurrency behavior and preemption capabilities.
///
/// ## Test Cases Identified from Source Analysis:
///
/// ### Strategy Initialization and Configuration
/// - [ ] Shared singleton instance access and consistency
/// - [ ] Custom instance creation and strategyId uniqueness
/// - [ ] makeStrategyId() returns correct "priorityBased" identifier
/// - [ ] Thread-safe state container initialization
/// - [ ] @unchecked Sendable conformance verification
///
/// ### Priority System Core Logic
/// - [ ] High priority (.high) can cancel low/none priority actions
/// - [ ] Low priority (.low) can cancel none priority actions
/// - [ ] None priority (.none) bypasses priority system entirely
/// - [ ] Priority comparison hierarchy validation
/// - [ ] Priority level precedence enforcement
///
/// ### canLock Method - None Priority Bypass
/// - [ ] Actions with .none priority always return .success
/// - [ ] No state modification during canLock with .none priority
/// - [ ] Bypasses all priority system logic for .none
/// - [ ] Consistent behavior regardless of existing locks
///
/// ### canLock Method - Priority vs Non-Priority
/// - [ ] Priority actions always succeed against non-priority actions
/// - [ ] Non-priority actions yield to any priority action
/// - [ ] Proper conflict resolution between priority and none types
/// - [ ] State consistency after priority preemption
///
/// ### canLock Method - Different Priority Levels
/// - [ ] High priority wins against low priority
/// - [ ] Low priority wins against none priority
/// - [ ] Higher priority actions can preempt lower priority
/// - [ ] Proper LockmanPriorityBasedError.precedingActionCancelled creation
/// - [ ] Error contains correct cancelled action information
///
/// ### canLock Method - Same Priority Level with ConcurrencyBehavior
/// - [ ] Exclusive behavior: existing action continues, new action fails
/// - [ ] Replaceable behavior: existing action canceled, new action succeeds
/// - [ ] Most recent priority action's behavior determines outcome
/// - [ ] OrderedDictionary insertion order preservation
/// - [ ] Proper same-action blocking logic
///
/// ### Same Action Conflict Resolution
/// - [ ] Same actionId with same uniqueId handling
/// - [ ] Same actionId with different uniqueId handling
/// - [ ] Exclusive same-action always fails
/// - [ ] Replaceable same-action behavior
/// - [ ] Error creation for same-action conflicts
///
/// ### lock Method Implementation
/// - [ ] Successfully adds lock to state after canLock success
/// - [ ] Preserves exact info instance with uniqueId
/// - [ ] Thread-safe lock addition across concurrent calls
/// - [ ] State consistency after multiple lock operations
/// - [ ] Priority order maintenance in state
///
/// ### unlock Method Implementation
/// - [ ] Successfully removes specific lock instance by uniqueId
/// - [ ] Only removes exact info instance that was locked
/// - [ ] Other locks with same actionId remain unaffected
/// - [ ] Thread-safe unlock operations
/// - [ ] Priority order consistency after unlock
/// - [ ] State cleanup when boundary becomes empty
///
/// ### Precedence Cancellation Logic
/// - [ ] successWithPrecedingCancellation result creation
/// - [ ] Proper LockmanPrecedingCancellationError propagation
/// - [ ] Cancelled action information preservation
/// - [ ] Multiple actions cancellation scenarios
/// - [ ] Priority chain reaction effects
///
/// ### Global Cleanup Operations
/// - [ ] cleanUp() removes all locks across all boundaries
/// - [ ] cleanUp(boundaryId:) removes only specified boundary locks
/// - [ ] Other boundaries remain unaffected by boundary-specific cleanup
/// - [ ] State is empty after global cleanup
/// - [ ] Priority order reset after cleanup
///
/// ### getCurrentLocks Debug Information
/// - [ ] Returns empty dictionary when no locks exist
/// - [ ] Returns correct boundary-to-locks mapping
/// - [ ] Priority order preservation in returned values
/// - [ ] Type-erased LockmanInfo instances in returned values
/// - [ ] Thread-safe access to current locks information
///
/// ### Logging Integration
/// - [ ] LockmanLogger.logCanLock called with correct parameters
/// - [ ] Proper strategy name "PriorityBased" in logs
/// - [ ] Correct failure reason messages for priority conflicts
/// - [ ] Cancelled action information in logs
/// - [ ] Log messages for different priority scenarios
///
/// ### Error Handling and Edge Cases
/// - [ ] Graceful handling of empty actionId strings
/// - [ ] Behavior with complex priority hierarchies
/// - [ ] State consistency under high concurrent load
/// - [ ] Memory management for long-running priority locks
/// - [ ] Edge cases in priority comparison logic
///
/// ### Thread Safety Verification
/// - [ ] Concurrent canLock calls with different priorities
/// - [ ] Concurrent lock/unlock operations with priority conflicts
/// - [ ] Concurrent cleanup operations
/// - [ ] State consistency under priority race conditions
/// - [ ] LockmanState thread-safety delegation
///
/// ### Protocol Conformance
/// - [ ] LockmanStrategy protocol implementation completeness
/// - [ ] Correct typealias I = LockmanPriorityBasedInfo
/// - [ ] All required protocol methods implemented
/// - [ ] Generic boundary type handling
/// - [ ] LockmanPrecedingCancellationError proper usage
///
