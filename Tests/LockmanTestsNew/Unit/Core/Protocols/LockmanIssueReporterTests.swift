/// Unit tests for LockmanIssueReporter
///
/// Tests the protocol for reporting issues in the Lockman framework with framework-agnostic abstraction.
///
/// ## Test Cases Identified from Source Analysis:
///
/// ### LockmanIssueReporter Protocol Definition
/// - [ ] Protocol method signature reportIssue(_:file:line:) validation
/// - [ ] Static method requirement verification
/// - [ ] Parameter types (String, StaticString, UInt) validation
/// - [ ] Protocol conformance by concrete implementations
/// - [ ] Method implementation requirements
/// - [ ] File and line parameter purpose and usage
///
/// ### LockmanDefaultIssueReporter Implementation
/// - [ ] LockmanIssueReporter protocol conformance validation
/// - [ ] enum-based implementation pattern
/// - [ ] reportIssue(_:file:line:) method implementation
/// - [ ] Default parameter values (#file, #line) behavior
/// - [ ] DEBUG conditional compilation behavior
/// - [ ] Console output formatting and structure
/// - [ ] File name extraction from StaticString path
///
/// ### DEBUG Build Conditional Behavior
/// - [ ] #if DEBUG compilation directive validation
/// - [ ] Debug-only issue reporting behavior
/// - [ ] Release build no-op behavior verification
/// - [ ] Performance impact in production builds
/// - [ ] Conditional compilation correctness
/// - [ ] DEBUG flag dependency validation
///
/// ### Console Output Formatting
/// - [ ] Warning emoji (⚠️) prefix usage
/// - [ ] "Lockman Issue" prefix format
/// - [ ] File name extraction from full path
/// - [ ] Line number formatting in output
/// - [ ] Message content preservation
/// - [ ] Output format consistency and readability
/// - [ ] Console integration and visibility
///
/// ### File Path Processing
/// - [ ] StaticString file parameter handling
/// - [ ] Path splitting by "/" separator
/// - [ ] Last component extraction for file name
/// - [ ] "Unknown" fallback for invalid paths
/// - [ ] Unicode path handling
/// - [ ] Long path truncation behavior
/// - [ ] Special character handling in paths
///
/// ### LockmanIssueReporting Configuration System
/// - [ ] Global reporter configuration management
/// - [ ] _reporter LockIsolated<any LockmanIssueReporter.Type> storage
/// - [ ] Default reporter initialization (LockmanDefaultIssueReporter.self)
/// - [ ] reporter property getter and setter behavior
/// - [ ] Thread-safe configuration changes
/// - [ ] Configuration persistence across operations
///
/// ### Reporter Type Management
/// - [ ] any LockmanIssueReporter.Type type erasure handling
/// - [ ] Dynamic reporter type assignment
/// - [ ] Reporter type resolution and method dispatch
/// - [ ] Type safety with protocol conformance
/// - [ ] Multiple reporter implementation support
/// - [ ] Reporter switching at runtime
///
/// ### Global reportIssue Method
/// - [ ] LockmanIssueReporting.reportIssue(_:file:line:) delegation
/// - [ ] Configured reporter method invocation
/// - [ ] Parameter forwarding to configured reporter
/// - [ ] Default parameter behavior (#file, #line)
/// - [ ] Source location preservation
/// - [ ] Message content unchanged propagation
///
/// ### LockIsolated Thread Safety Implementation
/// - [ ] LockIsolated<Value> private class implementation
/// - [ ] @unchecked Sendable conformance justification
/// - [ ] NSLock-based synchronization mechanism
/// - [ ] value property thread-safe access
/// - [ ] withValue<T>(_:) critical section method
/// - [ ] Lock acquisition and release patterns
/// - [ ] Concurrent access safety validation
///
/// ### Thread Safety and Concurrent Access
/// - [ ] Concurrent reporter configuration changes
/// - [ ] Concurrent issue reporting calls
/// - [ ] Race condition prevention in configuration
/// - [ ] Memory safety with concurrent access
/// - [ ] Lock contention handling
/// - [ ] Deadlock prevention mechanisms
///
/// ### Framework Abstraction and Independence
/// - [ ] Core framework independence from external dependencies
/// - [ ] TCA integration capability without core dependency

///
/// ### Error Handling and Edge Cases
/// - [ ] Invalid file path handling
/// - [ ] Very long message content handling
/// - [ ] Special characters in messages
/// - [ ] Unicode content in issue messages
/// - [ ] Memory pressure during issue reporting
/// - [ ] Reporter configuration during active reporting
///
/// ### Performance and Memory Management
/// - [ ] Issue reporting performance overhead
/// - [ ] Memory usage with message content
/// - [ ] File path processing efficiency
/// - [ ] Lock contention performance impact
/// - [ ] Large-scale issue reporting scalability
