/// Unit tests for LockmanUnlockOption
///
/// Tests the enumeration that controls when unlock operations are executed,
/// providing different options for releasing locks and coordinating with UI operations.
///
/// ## Test Cases Identified from Source Analysis:
///
/// ### Enum Case Creation and Properties
/// - [ ] LockmanUnlockOption.immediate case creation and equality
/// - [ ] LockmanUnlockOption.mainRunLoop case creation and equality
/// - [ ] LockmanUnlockOption.transition case creation and equality
/// - [ ] LockmanUnlockOption.delayed(TimeInterval) case creation and equality
/// - [ ] Associated value access for delayed case
/// - [ ] Sendable conformance verification for concurrent usage
///
/// ### Equatable Conformance
/// - [ ] Equality comparison between same case types
/// - [ ] Equality comparison between different case types
/// - [ ] delayed case equality with same TimeInterval values
/// - [ ] delayed case inequality with different TimeInterval values
/// - [ ] Complex equality scenarios across all cases
///
/// ### immediate Case Behavior
/// - [ ] immediate case represents synchronous unlock execution
/// - [ ] No delay or deferral associated with immediate
/// - [ ] Immediate case usage in performance-critical scenarios
/// - [ ] Immediate case compatibility with existing behavior
///
/// ### mainRunLoop Case Behavior
/// - [ ] mainRunLoop case represents RunLoop.main.perform deferral
/// - [ ] Minimal delay execution pattern
/// - [ ] Main thread execution coordination
/// - [ ] RunLoop cycle completion behavior
/// - [ ] State synchronization use cases
///
/// ### transition Case Behavior
/// - [ ] transition case represents platform-specific animation delays
/// - [ ] Default unlock option status
/// - [ ] UI transition coordination benefits
/// - [ ] Screen animation completion waiting
/// - [ ] Modal presentation/dismissal coordination
///
/// ### delayed Case Behavior
/// - [ ] delayed(TimeInterval) case with custom delay duration
/// - [ ] DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter execution pattern
/// - [ ] Precise timing control capabilities
/// - [ ] Custom animation duration coordination
/// - [ ] Network operation timeout scenarios
///
/// ### Platform-Specific Delay Documentation
/// - [ ] iOS delay duration (0.35 seconds for UINavigationController)
/// - [ ] macOS delay duration (0.25 seconds for window animations)
/// - [ ] tvOS delay duration (0.4 seconds for focus-driven transitions)
/// - [ ] watchOS delay duration (0.3 seconds for page-based navigation)
/// - [ ] Default fallback duration consistency
///
/// ### TimeInterval Associated Value
/// - [ ] TimeInterval parameter handling in delayed case
/// - [ ] Positive TimeInterval values
/// - [ ] Zero TimeInterval value behavior
/// - [ ] Negative TimeInterval value handling
/// - [ ] Very large TimeInterval value scenarios
/// - [ ] Fractional TimeInterval precision
///
/// ### Integration with LockmanUnlock
/// - [ ] Usage in LockmanUnlock.callAsFunction() switch statement
/// - [ ] Integration with unlock token execution
/// - [ ] Option-specific execution path verification
/// - [ ] Unlock timing coordination with different options
/// - [ ] Option parameter forwarding correctness
///
/// ### Use Case Scenarios
/// - [ ] Lightweight UI update coordination with mainRunLoop
/// - [ ] Screen transition coordination with transition
/// - [ ] Custom animation duration coordination with delayed
/// - [ ] Performance-critical immediate unlock scenarios
/// - [ ] Complex multi-step operation coordination
///
/// ### Sendable and Concurrent Usage
/// - [ ] Sendable conformance for cross-actor usage
/// - [ ] Thread-safe enum case access
/// - [ ] Concurrent unlock option evaluation
/// - [ ] Associated value access thread safety
/// - [ ] Actor isolation compatibility
///
/// ### Pattern Matching and Switch Usage
/// - [ ] Exhaustive switch statement coverage
/// - [ ] Pattern matching with immediate case
/// - [ ] Pattern matching with mainRunLoop case
/// - [ ] Pattern matching with transition case
/// - [ ] Pattern matching with delayed case and value extraction
/// - [ ] if case pattern matching for specific cases
/// - [ ] guard case pattern matching scenarios
///
/// ### Edge Cases and Validation
/// - [ ] Extremely long delay intervals
/// - [ ] Zero delay interval behavior
/// - [ ] Negative delay interval handling
/// - [ ] TimeInterval precision limits
/// - [ ] Platform-specific timing considerations
///
/// ### Memory and Performance
/// - [ ] Enum case memory efficiency
/// - [ ] Associated value storage efficiency
/// - [ ] Pattern matching performance
/// - [ ] Option evaluation overhead
/// - [ ] Memory management with delayed TimeInterval
///
/// ### Integration with UI Operations
/// - [ ] Navigation controller push/pop coordination
/// - [ ] Modal presentation/dismissal timing
/// - [ ] Window animation coordination on macOS
/// - [ ] Focus-driven transition timing on tvOS
/// - [ ] Page-based navigation on watchOS
///
/// ### Documentation and Usage Examples
/// - [ ] Code example syntax verification
/// - [ ] Usage pattern documentation accuracy
/// - [ ] Platform-specific documentation completeness
