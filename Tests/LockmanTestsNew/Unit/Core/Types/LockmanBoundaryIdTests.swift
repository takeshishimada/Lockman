/// Unit tests for LockmanBoundaryId
///
/// Tests the typealias protocol composition for boundary identifiers.
///
/// ## Test Cases Identified from Source Analysis:
///
/// ### Protocol Composition Validation
/// - [ ] Hashable protocol conformance requirement
/// - [ ] Sendable protocol conformance requirement
/// - [ ] Protocol composition behavior (Hashable & Sendable)
/// - [ ] Type constraint enforcement
/// - [ ] Compilation validation with conforming types
///
/// ### Hashable Behavior Testing
/// - [ ] Hash value consistency for same instances
/// - [ ] Hash value uniqueness for different instances
/// - [ ] Equality comparison behavior
/// - [ ] Dictionary key usage validation
/// - [ ] Set membership validation
/// - [ ] Hash collision handling
///
/// ### Sendable Behavior Testing
/// - [ ] Thread-safe concurrent access
/// - [ ] Safe passage across concurrent contexts
/// - [ ] Immutable value semantics
/// - [ ] No shared mutable state validation
/// - [ ] Concurrent collection usage
///
/// ### Built-in Type Conformance
/// - [ ] String as LockmanBoundaryId usage
/// - [ ] Int as LockmanBoundaryId usage
/// - [ ] UUID as LockmanBoundaryId usage
/// - [ ] Enum types as LockmanBoundaryId
/// - [ ] Struct types as LockmanBoundaryId
///
/// ### Custom Type Implementation
/// - [ ] Custom enum conformance patterns
/// - [ ] Custom struct conformance patterns
/// - [ ] Raw value enum conformance
/// - [ ] Associated value enum conformance
/// - [ ] Complex struct with multiple properties
///
/// ### Integration with Strategy System
/// - [ ] Boundary ID usage in strategy methods
/// - [ ] Type erasure with AnyLockmanBoundaryId
/// - [ ] Strategy container boundary management
/// - [ ] Lock acquisition with boundary IDs
/// - [ ] Cleanup operations with boundary IDs
///
/// ### Performance & Memory
/// - [ ] Hash computation performance
/// - [ ] Equality comparison performance
/// - [ ] Memory usage with various types
/// - [ ] Dictionary/Set performance with boundary IDs
/// - [ ] Large-scale boundary ID usage
///
/// ### Thread Safety & Concurrency
/// - [ ] Concurrent dictionary access with boundary IDs
/// - [ ] Concurrent set operations
/// - [ ] Thread-safe hash computation
/// - [ ] Race condition prevention
/// - [ ] Memory consistency across threads
///
/// ### Real-world Boundary ID Patterns
/// - [ ] User session boundaries
/// - [ ] Feature module boundaries
/// - [ ] Screen/view controller boundaries
/// - [ ] Data context boundaries
/// - [ ] Workflow step boundaries
///
/// ### Edge Cases & Error Conditions
/// - [ ] Empty string boundary IDs
/// - [ ] Very long string boundary IDs
/// - [ ] Special characters in boundary IDs
/// - [ ] Unicode boundary ID handling
/// - [ ] Hash collision scenarios
///
/// ### Type Safety Validation
/// - [ ] Compile-time type checking
/// - [ ] Runtime type safety
/// - [ ] Type constraint violation detection
/// - [ ] Generic type parameter validation
/// - [ ] Protocol composition constraint enforcement
