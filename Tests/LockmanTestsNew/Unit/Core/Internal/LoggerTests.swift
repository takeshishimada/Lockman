/// Unit tests for Logger
///
/// Tests the internal logging system that provides platform-appropriate logging capabilities
/// using OSLog on supported platforms with fallback behavior for SwiftUI previews.
///
/// ## Test Cases Identified from Source Analysis:
///
/// ### Logger Initialization and Configuration
/// - [ ] Shared singleton instance access and consistency
/// - [ ] isEnabled property default state (false)
/// - [ ] isEnabled property setter and getter behavior
/// - [ ] @MainActor isolation verification for thread safety
/// - [ ] @Published logs property reactive behavior
/// - [ ] Initial logs array state (empty)
///
/// ### Platform-Specific Logging Behavior
/// - [ ] OSLog integration on supported platforms (iOS 14+, macOS 11+, tvOS 14+, watchOS 7+)
/// - [ ] Fallback to print() for SwiftUI previews
/// - [ ] Logger subsystem "Lockman" and category "events" verification
/// - [ ] Platform availability checking correctness
/// - [ ] Preview environment detection via XCODE_RUNNING_FOR_PREVIEWS
///
/// ### DEBUG vs RELEASE Build Behavior
/// - [ ] Full logging functionality in DEBUG builds
/// - [ ] Inlined no-op behavior in RELEASE builds
/// - [ ] @inlinable @inline(__always) attribute effectiveness
/// - [ ] Memory and performance optimization in release builds
/// - [ ] Complete logging bypass in production
///
/// ### Log Method Functionality
/// - [ ] log(level:_:) with default OSLogType.default level
/// - [ ] Custom OSLogType level specification (info, debug, error, fault)
/// - [ ] @autoclosure parameter lazy evaluation
/// - [ ] Logging disabled when isEnabled is false
/// - [ ] String appending to logs array when enabled
/// - [ ] OSLog integration when available and enabled
///
/// ### Log Storage and Management
/// - [ ] logs array accumulation during enabled sessions
/// - [ ] Chronological order preservation in logs array
/// - [ ] Memory management with large numbers of log entries
/// - [ ] clear() method empties logs array completely
/// - [ ] @Published property change notifications
///
/// ### Environment Detection and Adaptation
/// - [ ] isRunningForPreviews detection via ProcessInfo
/// - [ ] Environment variable XCODE_RUNNING_FOR_PREVIEWS parsing
/// - [ ] Preview vs normal app execution differentiation
/// - [ ] Appropriate logging method selection based on environment
/// - [ ] Preview environment print() output verification
///
/// ### Conditional Compilation and Swift Version Support
/// - [ ] Swift 5.10+ @preconcurrency @MainActor support
/// - [ ] Swift <5.10 @MainActor(unsafe) fallback
/// - [ ] Platform availability annotations correctness
/// - [ ] Conditional compilation block organization
/// - [ ] Version-specific attribute application
///
/// ### OSLog Integration and Configuration
/// - [ ] os.Logger creation with correct subsystem and category
/// - [ ] OSLogType level mapping and usage
/// - [ ] String interpolation in OSLog messages
/// - [ ] OSLog performance characteristics
/// - [ ] Integration with system logging infrastructure
///
/// ### Thread Safety and Actor Isolation
/// - [ ] @MainActor requirement enforcement
/// - [ ] Thread-safe access to isEnabled property
/// - [ ] Thread-safe access to logs array
/// - [ ] @Published property updates from main actor
/// - [ ] Concurrent logging operation safety
///
/// ### Performance and Memory Considerations
/// - [ ] @autoclosure lazy evaluation effectiveness
/// - [ ] String interpolation overhead in disabled state
/// - [ ] Memory usage of accumulated logs
/// - [ ] OSLog overhead vs print() overhead
/// - [ ] Inlining effectiveness in release builds
///
/// ### Integration with Lockman Framework
/// - [ ] Usage patterns from LockmanLogger
/// - [ ] Framework event logging scenarios
/// - [ ] Debug information collection
/// - [ ] Error and warning log generation
/// - [ ] Performance metric logging
///
/// ### Error Handling and Edge Cases
/// - [ ] Behavior with nil or empty log messages
/// - [ ] Very long log message handling
/// - [ ] Unicode character support in log messages
/// - [ ] Logging during app lifecycle events
/// - [ ] Memory pressure scenarios
///
/// ### Testing and Development Support
/// - [ ] Log capture for test verification
/// - [ ] Test isolation and cleanup
/// - [ ] Mock logging scenarios for testing
/// - [ ] Development debug information access
/// - [ ] Logging state verification in tests
///
