  /// Unit tests for LockmanConcurrencyLimitedMacro
  ///
  /// Tests the macro that generates conformance to LockmanConcurrencyLimitedAction protocol
  /// and provides concurrency-limited action management with actionName property generation.
  ///
  /// ## Test Cases Identified from Source Analysis:
  ///
  /// ### ExtensionMacro Protocol Implementation
  /// - [ ] Extension generation for conformance to LockmanConcurrencyLimitedAction
  /// - [ ] ExtensionDeclSyntax creation with correct type and protocol

  /// - [ ] Extension declaration format validation
  /// - [ ] Multiple inheritance scenario handling
  ///
  /// ### MemberMacro Protocol Implementation
  /// - [ ] Member generation for enum declarations
  /// - [ ] actionName property generation using generateActionNameMembers
  /// - [ ] Enum extraction and validation with extractEnumDecl
  /// - [ ] Non-enum declaration handling (graceful failure)
  /// - [ ] Empty member array return for invalid declarations
  ///
  /// ### Concurrency Limited Strategy Integration
  /// - [ ] LockmanConcurrencyLimitedAction protocol conformance generation
  /// - [ ] Integration with concurrency limited strategy system
