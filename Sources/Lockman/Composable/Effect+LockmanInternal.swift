// MARK: - Internal Implementation for Lockman Effects

extension Effect {
  /// Attempts to acquire a lock using the provided strategy and executes the effect if successful.
  ///
  /// ## Lock Acquisition Protocol
  /// This method implements the core lock acquisition and effect execution logic:
  /// 1. **Feasibility Check**: Call `canLock` to determine if lock can be acquired
  /// 2. **Early Exit**: Return `.none` if lock acquisition is not possible
  /// 3. **Lock Acquisition**: Call `lock` to actually acquire the lock
  /// 4. **Cancellation Handling**: If existing operation needs cancellation, handle appropriately
  /// 5. **Effect Execution**: Execute the provided effect with lock held
  ///
  /// ## Boundary Lock Protection
  /// The entire lock acquisition process is protected by a boundary-specific lock
  /// to ensure atomicity and prevent race conditions between:
  /// - Multiple lock acquisition attempts
  /// - Lock acquisition and release operations
  /// - Cleanup and acquisition operations
  ///
  /// ## Cancellation Strategy
  /// When `canLock` returns `.successWithPrecedingCancellation`:
  /// 1. A cancellation effect is created for the specified boundaryId
  /// 2. The cancellation effect is concatenated BEFORE the main effect
  /// 3. This ensures proper ordering: cancel existing â†’ execute new
  ///
  /// ## Performance Notes
  /// - Lock feasibility check is typically O(1) hash lookup
  /// - Boundary lock acquisition is brief (microseconds)
  /// - Effect concatenation has minimal overhead
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - lockmanInfo: Lock information for the strategy (action ID, unique ID, etc.)
  ///   - strategy: Type-erased strategy to use for lock operations
  ///   - boundaryId: Boundary identifier for this lock and cancellation
  ///   - effect: Effect to execute if lock acquisition succeeds
  /// - Returns: Effect to execute, or `.none` if lock acquisition fails

  /// Handles errors that occur during lock operations and provides appropriate diagnostic messages.
  ///
  /// ## Error Analysis and Reporting
  /// This method examines the error type and generates context-aware diagnostic messages
  /// that help developers identify and resolve issues with lock management operations.
  /// The diagnostics include:
  /// - **Source Location**: Exact file, line, and column where error occurred
  /// - **Error Context**: Specific action type and strategy type involved
  /// - **Resolution Guidance**: Concrete steps to fix the issue
  /// - **Code Examples**: Sample code showing correct usage
  ///
  /// ## Supported Error Types
  /// Currently handles `LockmanError` types with specific guidance:
  /// - **Strategy Not Registered**: Provides registration example
  /// - **Strategy Already Registered**: Explains registration constraints
  /// - **Future Extensions**: Framework for additional error types
  ///
  /// ## Development vs Production
  /// In development builds, detailed diagnostics are provided to help developers
  /// identify and fix issues quickly. In production, error handling is minimal
  /// to avoid exposing internal details.
  ///
  /// ## Integration with Xcode
  /// The `reportIssue` function integrates with Xcode's issue navigator,
  /// providing clickable error messages that jump directly to the problematic code.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - error: Error that was thrown during lock operation
  ///   - fileID: File identifier where error originated (auto-populated)
  ///   - filePath: Full file path where error originated (auto-populated)
  ///   - line: Line number where error originated (auto-populated)
  ///   - column: Column number where error originated (auto-populated)

  /// Builds an effect with lock acquisition and automatic unlock.
  ///
  /// ## Purpose
  /// This internal method contains the common logic shared by all lock variants:
  /// 1. Strategy resolution from the container
  /// 2. Lock information extraction from the action
  /// 3. Lock acquisition and result handling
  /// 4. Direct effect concatenation with unlock effect
  ///
  /// ## Simplified Architecture
  /// This method directly creates the unlock effect and concatenates it with the operations,
  /// eliminating the need for complex closure patterns and intermediate wrappers.
  ///
  /// ## Error Handling Strategy
  /// This method uses a do-catch pattern to handle strategy resolution errors.
  /// If strategy resolution fails, it calls `handleError` to provide detailed
  /// diagnostic information and optionally calls the provided handler before
  /// returning `.none` to prevent effect execution.
  ///
  /// ## Type Safety
  /// The method maintains type safety through generic constraints:
  /// - `B: LockmanBoundaryId`: Ensures valid boundary identifier
  /// - `A: LockmanAction`: Ensures valid action with lock information
  /// - `A.I`: Preserves lock information type relationship
  ///
  /// ## Effect Execution Order
  /// The returned effect executes in this order:
  /// 1. Operations (cancellable as a group)
  /// 2. Unlock effect (non-cancellable, always executes)
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - operations: Array of effects to execute while lock is held
  ///   - action: LockmanAction providing lock information and strategy type
  ///   - boundaryId: Unique identifier for cancellation and lock boundary
  ///   - unlockOption: Unlock option configuration for when to execute the unlock
  ///   - fileID: Source file ID for error reporting
  ///   - filePath: Source file path for error reporting
  ///   - line: Source line number for error reporting
  ///   - column: Source column number for error reporting
  ///   - handler: Optional error handler for lock acquisition failures
  /// - Returns: Built effect, or `.none` if setup fails
