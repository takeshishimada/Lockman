# Migrating to 1.2

Update your code from Lockman 1.1 to take advantage of Lockman 1.2's automatic cancellation ID management and enhanced safety features.

## Overview

Lockman 1.2 introduces a major developer experience improvement by automatically handling cancellation IDs for all Effect.lock operations. This eliminates the need to manually specify `.cancellable(id: boundaryId)` when using `.run()` methods with Lockman's lock functionality, resulting in cleaner, more maintainable code.

The key improvements include:
- Automatic cancellation ID management for all Effect.lock methods
- "Guaranteed Resource Cleanup" design principle implementation
- Enhanced safety with improved cancellation scope control
- Comprehensive documentation with before/after examples

## Updating dependencies

To upgrade to Lockman 1.2, update your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
  .package(
    url: "https://github.com/takeshishimada/Lockman",
    from: "1.2.0"
  )
]
```

## Non-breaking changes

**Important:** Lockman 1.2 is **100% backward compatible**. All existing code will continue to work without any modifications. However, you can now simplify your code significantly by removing manual cancellation ID specifications.

## Major improvements

### Automatic cancellation ID management

All Effect.lock methods now automatically apply `.cancellable(id: boundaryId)` to operations, eliminating the need for manual specification.

### Enhanced cancellation scope control

The "Guaranteed Resource Cleanup" principle ensures that:
- **Operations are cancellable**: Business logic can be cancelled using the boundaryId
- **Resource cleanup is guaranteed**: Lock release always executes regardless of cancellation
- **Deadlock prevention**: Fixed potential deadlock scenarios in concatenated operations

## Migration opportunities

While no changes are required, you can simplify your existing code to take advantage of the new automatic cancellation features.

### Method chain style (.lock)

üü° Before (1.1 - still works):
```swift
return .run { send in
  await performAsyncWork()
  await send(.completed)
}
.cancellable(id: boundaryId)  // Manual specification
.lock(action: action, boundaryId: boundaryId)
```

‚úÖ After (1.2 - simplified):
```swift
return .run { send in
  await performAsyncWork()
  await send(.completed)
}
.lock(action: action, boundaryId: boundaryId)  // Automatic application!
```

### Static method style (.withLock)

üü° Before (1.1 - still works):
```swift
return .withLock(
  operation: { send in
    try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 100_000_000)
    await send(.completed)
  },
  action: action,
  boundaryId: CancelID.operation
)
// Additional .cancellable(id:) was not needed here in 1.1
```

‚úÖ After (1.2 - enhanced safety):
```swift
return .withLock(
  operation: { send in
    try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 100_000_000)
    await send(.completed)
  },
  action: action,
  boundaryId: CancelID.operation
)
// Now with enhanced "Guaranteed Resource Cleanup" safety
```

### Concatenated operations

üü° Before (1.1 - potential deadlock risk):
```swift
return .withLock(
  concatenating: [
    .run { send in await send(.stepOne) },
    .run { send in await send(.stepTwo) },
    .run { send in await send(.stepThree) }
  ],
  action: action,
  boundaryId: CancelID.operation
)
```

‚úÖ After (1.2 - deadlock prevention):
```swift
return .withLock(
  concatenating: [
    .run { send in await send(.stepOne) },
    .run { send in await send(.stepTwo) },
    .run { send in await send(.stepThree) }
  ],
  action: action,
  boundaryId: CancelID.operation
)
// Enhanced with proper cancellation scope management
```

### Manual unlock operations

üü° Before (1.1):
```swift
return .withLock(
  operation: { send, unlock in
    defer { unlock() }
    try await performCriticalWork()
    await send(.completed)
  },
  action: action,
  boundaryId: CancelID.operation
)
```

‚úÖ After (1.2 - with automatic cancellation):
```swift
return .withLock(
  operation: { send, unlock in
    defer { unlock() }
    try await performCriticalWork()
    await send(.completed)
  },
  action: action,
  boundaryId: CancelID.operation
)
// Now includes automatic cancellation ID management
```

## Code cleanup recommendations

### Remove redundant .cancellable(id:) calls

You can now remove manual `.cancellable(id:)` specifications when using `.lock()`:

üü° Before (can be simplified):
```swift
@Reducer
struct MyFeature {
  // ... state and action definitions ...
  
  var body: some Reducer<State, Action> {
    Reduce { state, action in
      switch action {
      case .fetchData:
        return .run { send in
          let data = try await apiClient.fetchData()
          await send(.dataReceived(data))
        }
        .cancellable(id: CancelID.fetch)  // ‚Üê Remove this line
        .lock(action: action, boundaryId: CancelID.fetch)
        
      case .dataReceived(let data):
        state.data = data
        return .none
      }
    }
  }
}
```

‚úÖ After (simplified):
```swift
@Reducer
struct MyFeature {
  // ... state and action definitions ...
  
  var body: some Reducer<State, Action> {
    Reduce { state, action in
      switch action {
      case .fetchData:
        return .run { send in
          let data = try await apiClient.fetchData()
          await send(.dataReceived(data))
        }
        .lock(action: action, boundaryId: CancelID.fetch)  // Automatic cancellation!
        
      case .dataReceived(let data):
        state.data = data
        return .none
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Simplify complex effect chains

üü° Before (verbose):
```swift
return .merge(
  .run { send in
    await send(.started)
  },
  .run { send in
    try await performWork()
    await send(.workCompleted)
  }
  .cancellable(id: boundaryId)  // ‚Üê Remove this
  .lock(action: action, boundaryId: boundaryId),
  
  .run { send in
    await send(.monitoring)
  }
)
```

‚úÖ After (clean):
```swift
return .merge(
  .run { send in
    await send(.started)
  },
  .run { send in
    try await performWork()
    await send(.workCompleted)
  }
  .lock(action: action, boundaryId: boundaryId),  // Clean and automatic!
  
  .run { send in
    await send(.monitoring)
  }
)
```

## Enhanced safety features

### Guaranteed resource cleanup

Lockman 1.2 implements the "Guaranteed Resource Cleanup" principle:

```swift
// This operation can be cancelled, but the unlock will ALWAYS execute
return .withLock(
  operation: { send in
    try await riskyOperation()  // ‚Üê Can be cancelled
    await send(.completed)
  },
  action: action,
  boundaryId: CancelID.operation
)
// unlock() is guaranteed to execute even if operation is cancelled
```

### Improved concatenated operations

Concatenated operations now have safer cancellation scope management:

```swift
return .withLock(
  concatenating: [
    .run { send in await step1(send) },    // ‚Üê These operations are cancellable
    .run { send in await step2(send) },    // ‚Üê as a group
    .run { send in await step3(send) }     // ‚Üê 
  ],
  action: action,
  boundaryId: CancelID.workflow
)
// The unlock effect is NOT cancellable - guaranteed cleanup
```

## Benefits of upgrading

1. **Cleaner code**: Remove boilerplate `.cancellable(id:)` calls
2. **Enhanced safety**: "Guaranteed Resource Cleanup" prevents resource leaks
3. **Deadlock prevention**: Improved cancellation scope management
4. **Better maintainability**: Less manual cancellation ID management
5. **Improved developer experience**: More intuitive API usage
6. **Zero performance impact**: Automatic features add no runtime overhead

## Testing your migration

After removing manual `.cancellable(id:)` calls, verify that:

1. **Cancellation still works**: Test that operations can be properly cancelled
2. **Resource cleanup**: Ensure locks are properly released
3. **No deadlocks**: Verify concatenated operations work correctly
4. **Error handling**: Check that error handlers still receive proper errors

## Complete migration example

Here's a complete example showing a typical migration:

üü° Before (1.1):
```swift
@Reducer
struct PaymentFeature {
  struct State: Equatable {
    var isProcessing = false
    var result: PaymentResult?
  }
  
  @CasePathable
  enum Action: Equatable, LockmanAction {
    case processPayment(amount: Decimal)
    case paymentCompleted(PaymentResult)
    case paymentFailed
    
    var lockmanInfo: LockmanSingleExecutionInfo {
      .init(actionId: "payment", mode: .boundary)
    }
  }
  
  enum CancelID: LockmanBoundaryId {
    case payment
  }
  
  var body: some Reducer<State, Action> {
    Reduce { state, action in
      switch action {
      case .processPayment(let amount):
        state.isProcessing = true
        return .run { send in
          do {
            let result = try await paymentService.process(amount)
            await send(.paymentCompleted(result))
          } catch {
            await send(.paymentFailed)
          }
        }
        .cancellable(id: CancelID.payment)  // ‚Üê Manual specification
        .lock(action: action, boundaryId: CancelID.payment)
        
      case .paymentCompleted(let result):
        state.isProcessing = false
        state.result = result
        return .none
        
      case .paymentFailed:
        state.isProcessing = false
        return .none
      }
    }
  }
}
```

‚úÖ After (1.2):
```swift
@Reducer
struct PaymentFeature {
  struct State: Equatable {
    var isProcessing = false
    var result: PaymentResult?
  }
  
  @CasePathable
  enum Action: Equatable, LockmanAction {
    case processPayment(amount: Decimal)
    case paymentCompleted(PaymentResult)
    case paymentFailed
    
    var lockmanInfo: LockmanSingleExecutionInfo {
      .init(actionId: "payment", mode: .boundary)
    }
  }
  
  enum CancelID: LockmanBoundaryId {
    case payment
  }
  
  var body: some Reducer<State, Action> {
    Reduce { state, action in
      switch action {
      case .processPayment(let amount):
        state.isProcessing = true
        return .run { send in
          do {
            let result = try await paymentService.process(amount)
            await send(.paymentCompleted(result))
          } catch {
            await send(.paymentFailed)
          }
        }
        .lock(action: action, boundaryId: CancelID.payment)  // ‚Üê Automatic cancellation!
        
      case .paymentCompleted(let result):
        state.isProcessing = false
        state.result = result
        return .none
        
      case .paymentFailed:
        state.isProcessing = false
        return .none
      }
    }
  }
}
```
