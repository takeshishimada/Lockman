## Detailed Gap Analysis

### 1. Concurrency Testing Gaps

#### Missing Test Categories
- **Race Conditions**: Multiple threads accessing same boundary
- **Deadlock Prevention**: Circular dependency scenarios
- **Lock Ordering**: Consistent ordering across strategies
- **High Contention**: Performance under heavy concurrent load
- **Memory Model**: Proper synchronization guarantees

#### Risk Assessment
```
Risk Level: CRITICAL
Probability: HIGH (concurrent access is common)
Impact: SEVERE (data corruption, deadlocks)
Detection: LOW (only manifests under specific conditions)
```

### 2. Integration Testing Gaps

#### Strategy Combination Scenarios
- **Composite + Priority**: Complex nested priority handling
- **Concurrency + Group**: Resource limits with coordination
- **Dynamic + Single**: Condition evaluation with exclusivity
- **Multi-Strategy**: Boundary ID conflicts across strategies

#### TCA Integration Gaps
- **Effect Chaining**: Complex effect composition
- **State Mutations**: Concurrent state modifications
- **Error Propagation**: Error handling across reducer boundaries
- **Cancellation**: Proper cleanup during cancellation

### 3. State Management Gaps

#### Cleanup Scenarios
- **Abnormal Termination**: Process/task termination during lock
- **Exception During Lock**: State consistency after exceptions
- **Memory Pressure**: Behavior under low memory conditions
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Handling of resource limits

#### Edge Cases
- **Rapid Lock/Unlock**: High-frequency operations
- **Long-Running Operations**: Extended lock duration effects
- **Boundary ID Reuse**: Safe reuse patterns
- **Strategy Switching**: Dynamic strategy changes

### 4. Performance & Scalability Gaps

#### Missing Metrics
- **Throughput**: Operations per second under various loads
- **Latency**: Lock acquisition and release times
- **Memory Usage**: Peak and sustained memory consumption
- **CPU Usage**: Processing overhead measurement
- **Scalability**: Performance across different core counts

#### Load Testing Scenarios
- **High Frequency**: Thousands of operations per second
- **Many Boundaries**: Hundreds of concurrent boundaries
- **Mixed Workloads**: Different strategies under same load
- **Long Duration**: Extended runtime stability

## Conclusion

The current test suite provides good coverage for basic functionality but has critical gaps in concurrency, integration, and real-world usage scenarios. The identified gaps represent significant risks to the library's reliability and performance in production environments.

The recommended approach prioritizes the most critical gaps (concurrency and integration) while establishing a foundation for comprehensive, long-term test coverage improvements.

Implementation of these recommendations will significantly improve the library's quality, reliability, and maintainability while providing confidence for production deployment.
